# Redis Pub/Sub

Let's see how Redis implements the Pub/Sub model using the example of private messages in the messenger.

A websocket microservice subscribes to the messenger events using the subscribe channel [channel ...] command:
```
127.0.0.1:6379> subscribe messages
Reading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit)
1) subscribe
2) "messages"
3) (integer) 1
```
Execution of the command returns 1 if the subscription to the channel was successful and the connection is blocked, waiting for messages.

When a new message is sent, a web server publishes an event to Redis with the publish channel message command:
```
127.0.0.1:6379> publish messages '{"user_id":123456,"message_id":"f112aa8a-3966-4070-a990-cf7afcdf0eea","message_text":"Oh, hi Mark!","sent_at":1649294564}'
(integer) 1
```

The publish command returns the number of clients that received the broadcast message.

A message instantly arrives from the WebSocket microservice side:
```
1) "message"
2) "messages"
3) "{\"user_id\":123456,\"message_id\":\"f112aa8a-3966-4070-a990-cf7afcdf0eea\",\"message_text\":\"Oh, hi Mark!\",\" sent_at\":1649294564}"
```
1 means action; 2 â€” channel from where the message has come; 3 message body.

# When to use Pub/Sub

Important note: use Redis Pub/Sub only in cases when your server can lose events
<br>
If there are no subscribers at the time of publishing, or if the user does not have an open WebSocket connection, the event will be gone. For example, use Pub/Sub for notifications about new messages in a messenger. If a user is online, he will see any change in real-time. But when the user reloads a page, he will receive all data from a server via API.
<br>
However, this architecture is clearly cannot be used to send emails or SMS notifications.
